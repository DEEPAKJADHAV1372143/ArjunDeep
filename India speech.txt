The most significant event between the 7th and 11th century was the Tripartite struggle centred on
 Kannauj that lasted for more than two centuries between the Pala Empire, Rashtrakuta Empire, and 
Gurjara-Pratihara Empire. Southern India saw the rise of multiple imperial powers from the middle 
of the fifth century, most notably the Chalukya, Chola, Pallava, Chera, Pandyan, and Western Chalukya 
Empires. The Chola dynasty conquered southern India and successfully invaded parts of Southeast Asia,
 Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and Bengal[14] in the 11th century.[15][16] In the early medieval period Indian 
mathematics, including Hindu numerals, influenced the development of mathematics and astronomy in the 
Arab world.[17]



From the late 18th century to the mid-19th century, large areas of India were annexed by the British 
East India Company of the British Empire. Dissatisfaction with Company rule led to the Indian Rebellion
 of 1857, after which the British provinces of India were directly administered by the British Crown and
 witnessed a period of rapid development of infrastructure, economic decline and major famines.[26][27]
[28][29][30] During the first half of the 20th century, a nationwide struggle for independence was launched
, led by the Indian National Congress, which was later joined by other organisations. The Indian subcontinent
 gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1947, after the British provinces were partitioned into the
 dominions of India and Pakistan and the princely states all acceded to one of the new states.
